a coin bot tutorial in python related to the Zurich Meetup sessions : https://www.meetup.com/coinbots-meetup-in-zurich/

We will start fron scratch and build the knowledge up.

### FIRST THINGS FIRST

#### We will start by using the coinbase python API for the first sessions
+ make sure to have a coinbase account. This serves as well for GDAX : https://www.coinbase.com/ or https://www.gdax.com/ (to create an account you might need two-steps verifications and an ID document: ie. passport, driver license, etc...)

+ have python 3+ installed (currenlty using 3.5) : https://www.python.org/downloads/
+ install anaconda : https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/
+ use this python version as a specific environment : https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html
+ make sure you have pip installed : ie type 'pip --version' in your console log
+ install coinbase package : 'pip install coinbase'
+ install gdax package : 'pip install gdax'

#### Here are the starting references
+ Coinbase-python on Github : https://github.com/coinbase/coinbase-python
+ Coinbase python API : https://developers.coinbase.com/api/v2?python#
